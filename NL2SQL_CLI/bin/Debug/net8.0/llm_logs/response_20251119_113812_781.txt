To find orders from last month, we use the dateadd function to subtract one month from the current date, and filter for orders with ship date within that range.

SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, ShipDate, ShipCountry, Freight
FROM dbo.Orders
WHERE ShipDate BETWEEN DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()) AND GETDATE()
ORDER BY OrderDate DESC;
