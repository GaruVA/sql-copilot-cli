1. Brief explanation:
To find total orders for each customer, we can use COUNT(*) function to count all rows in the Orders table for each customer and then group by the customerID to get the total number of orders for each customer.

2. SQL queries:
Total orders for each customer:
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS TotalOrders
FROM Customers JOIN Orders ON Customers.customerID = Orders.customerID
GROUP BY Customers.customerID;
