To find total orders, we count all rows in the Orders table.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders FROM dbo.Orders;

To find total freight cost, we sum all the freight column from the Orders table.

SELECT SUM(Orders.Freight) AS TotalFreightCost FROM dbo.Orders;

To list products with their category names, we join the Products and Categories tableses.

SELECT Products.ProductID, Products.ProductName, Categories.CategoryName
FROM dbo.Products AS Products JOIN dbo.Categories AS Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;

SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, ShipDate, ShipCountry, Freight

SELECT TOP 5 ProductName, CategoryName, Revenue
FROM (SELECT Products.ProductName, Categories.CategoryName, Products.ProductID, (SELECT SUM(OrderDetails.UnitsInStock * Products.UnitPrice) AS Revenue FROM dbo.Products AS Products JOIN dbo.OrderDetails ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID JOIN dbo.Orders ON OrderDetails.OrderID =
