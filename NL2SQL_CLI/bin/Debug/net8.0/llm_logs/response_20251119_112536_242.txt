To find total orders for each customer, we use a subquery to find the total orders for each customer and join it back to the main query to get the customer name.

SELECT c.customername, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM customers c JOIN (SELECT customerid, COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders GROUP BY customerid) AS subquery ON c.customerid = subquery.customerid
GROUP BY c.customername, subquery.total_orders;
